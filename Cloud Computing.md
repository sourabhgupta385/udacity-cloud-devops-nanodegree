# Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing is the delivery of IT resources over the Internet. The cloud is like a virtual data center accessible via the Internet that allows you to manage:
- Storage services likes databases
- Servers, compute power, networking
- Analytics, artificial intelligence, augmented reality
- Security services for data and applications

## Characteristics of Cloud Computing

- **Pay as you go** - You pay only for what you use and only when your code runs.
- **Autoscaling** - The number of active servers can grow or shrink based on demand.
- **Serverless** - Allows you to write and deploy code without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

## Types of Cloud Computing

### Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)

The provider supplies virtual server instances, storage, and mechanisms for you to manage servers.

### Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS)

A platform of development tools hosted on a provider's infrastructure.

### Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)

A software application that runs over the Internet and is managed by the service provider.

## Cloud Deployment Models

### Public Cloud

A public cloud makes resources available over the Internet to the general public.

### Private Cloud

A private cloud is a proprietary network that supplies services to a limited number of people.

### Hybrid Cloud

A hybrid model contains a combination of both a public and a private cloud.
The hybrid model is a growing trend in the industry for those organizations that have been slow to adopt the cloud due to being in a heavily regulated industry. The hybrid model gives organizations the flexibility to slowly migrate to the cloud.

## Benefits
There are several benefits to the cloud.

- Stop guessing about capacity.
- Avoid huge capital investments up front.
- Pay for only what you use.
- Scale globally in minutes.
- Deliver faster.

## Global Infrastructure

### Region

A region is considered a geographic location or an area on a map.

### Availability Zone

An availability zone is an isolated location within a geographic region and is a physical data center within a specific region.

### Edge Location

An edge location is as a mini-data center used solely to cache large data files closer to a user's location.

### Additional Information
- There are more Availability Zones (AZs) than there are Regions.
- There should be at least two AZs per Region.
- Each region is located in a separate geographic area.
- AZs are distinct locations that are engineered to be isolated from failures.
