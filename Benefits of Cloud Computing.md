# What are the Top Eight Benefits of Cloud Computing?

### Cost

There is no up-front cost and resources can be precisely metered to meet demand.

### Speed

The cloud offers self-service, so an expert user can leverage the resources to build solutions quickly.

### Global scale

All major cloud providers have a global scale, which means services can be provisioned all over the world to meet demand in a geographic region.

### Productivity

Many tasks, such as racking servers, configuring network hardware, and physically securing a data center, no longer exists. Companies can focus on building core intellectual property versus reinventing the wheel.

### Performance

The performance of applications can leverage a continuous upgrade cycle. The network, the storage and the compute improve over time consistently. Additionally, Cloud-Native applications are able to leverage new capabilities in the cloud to further increase performance.

### Reliability

The core architecture of the cloud offers redundancy at every step. There are multiple regions and multiple data centers in each region. Cloud-native architecture can design around these capabilities, leading to highly available architectures. Additionally, many-core cloud services are themselves highly available, like Amazon S3, which has nine nines, or 99.999999999% reliability.

### Security

You are only as good as your weakest link with security. By consolidating to centralized security, a higher level of security occurs. Problems such as physical access to a data center or encryption at rest become industry standard on day one.

### Relational Database

A relational database is a tabular system that stores a finite amount of information. You can think of a relational database as a spreadsheet of values/data, where each row in the spreadsheet has a unique ID.
